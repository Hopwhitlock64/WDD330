    <h3>Notes</h3> 
        <li>Memoization, provides result caching. This means we can save a result as a chache object meaning we can access it later rather than have to compute the result again</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFE), an annoynomous function that returns a result as soon as its defined.</li>
       
        <p>Example:   
            (function(){
            const temp = 'World';
            console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);
            })();
            << 'Hello World'</p>
       
        <li>When you want to have temporary variables, place them inside an IIFE so it will only be available when IIFE is invoked</li>
        <li>A Promise. A proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure. It will return either resolved or rejected. </li>
        <p>Creating a promise:   
            const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
                // initialization code goes here
                if (success) {
                    resolve(value);
                } else {
                    reject(error);
                }
            });
        </p>
        <li>.then() method returns a promise and takes up to two arguments</li>
        <li>Ajax: Asynchonous, JavaScript, XML(JSON is now used instead of XML because its lighter weight and easier to parse)</li>

    <ul>
        <li>When would we want to use the Redirect() method? Also if there's no current browser support, how would we use it?</li>
        <li>How would you use/implement the Request() constructor?</li>
