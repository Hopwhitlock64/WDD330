    <li><a href="#">Week 1 notes</a>  var/let  acting like a label on a box was helpful reminder of what it does. Another thing I like was when the author menioed putting buttons within a section since the section tag requires the full length of the page, the buttons will end up on the next line. I feel like I knew that, but it was a great reminder.
        The review in the book was helpful and brought back alot of things but there were just a few things I liked clarified again. Looked up some additional resources on how to make a dynamic table of contents for more clarification and as a refresher.
