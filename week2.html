        I learned the difference between the spread and rest operator. and that you can use them with both arrays and functions. I also did some practice with some sample arrays that I created.
         Overall I liked the refresher with loops and functions. I think the map() method would be good when wanting to try out combining arrays wiht each othre without affecting the original arrays. I'm still trying to understand callback functions a little better regarding the three parameters.

        <ul>
            <li>What's the difference between the rest and spread operator? </li>
            <p>Rest collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
               Spread operator or syntax "expands" an array into its elements. 
               Allows an array or expression in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected .</p>
            <li>How does the rest operator work in a function? </li>
