    <li><a href="#">Notes</a>  Arrow functions are great when you want to shorten and clean up your code while calling a function. 
        I learned the difference between the spread and rest operator. and that you can use them with both arrays and functions. I also did some practice with some sample arrays that I created.
         Overall I liked the refresher with loops and functions. I think the map() method would be good when wanting to try out combining arrays wiht each othre without affecting the original arrays. I'm still trying to understand callback functions a little better regarding the three parameters.
       <h3>Practive functions and arrays</h3>
       <script>
        const flavors = ["Strawberry", "Blueberry", "Lemon", "Mint", "chocolate", "Vanilla"];
        const countries  = ["England", "France", "United States of America", "Costa Rica", "Peru", "Italy", "Japan"];
        const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,23,76,123,785,1254];
        const names = ["James", "sally", "Frank", "Jason", "Harry", "Samantha", "Kelly"];
        const animals = ["Dog", "Cat", "Dolphin", "Fish", "Skunk", "Bear", "Deer"];

        // for loop
        for(let i = 0 ; i < numbers.length; i++){
            console.log(numbers[i]);
            }
        // rest operator
        function rest(...flavors){
            return flavors;
        }
        // spread operator
        function sum(x, y, z) {
            return x + y + z;
        }
        console.log(sum(...numbers));  

       </script> 
       <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What's the difference between the rest and spread operator? </li>
            <p>Rest collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
               Spread operator or syntax "expands" an array into its elements. 
               Allows an array or expression in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected .</p>
            <li>How does the rest operator work in a function? </li>
