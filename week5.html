    <h3>Notes</h3> 
        <li>Debugg throughout your code and test frequently to make sure your code is performing like you want</li>
        <li>You can debug with the debugger keyword but it's cleaner to use breakpoints throughout your code</li>
        <li>TDD- Test Driven Development. Writing tests before code, once code is written, its continually tested so it can be refactored</li>
        <li>Testing frameworks provide structure for more productive tests</li>
        <li>Try and catch blocks are important when handling errors and exceptions. If the try part fails then the catch part catches it and handles the error</li>
