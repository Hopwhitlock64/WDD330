    <h3>Notes</h3> 
        <li>JSON.stringify converts objects to json strings. JSON is a string</li>
        <li>constructor is automatically called when new</li>
        <li>preventDefault() method prevents the form from being submitted</li>
        <li>Form validation can occur both on the client side using JavaScript and server side. Its best to use both to make sure there are no errors.</li>
        <li> A JavaScript constructor function is used to create an object</li>
        <li>The focus and blur events can be used to validate input fields and are generally used with forms</li>
        <li>Focusing on an element generally means: “prepare to accept the data here”. </li>
        <li>Blur means the focus is lost and the user clicks somewhere else or goes to the next form field, that is usually when data has been enter into a field</li>
        <li>The focus eventhides the error message</li>
        <li>The blur handler checks to see if the desire input has been entered, if not it shows an error</li>
        <li>Code Coupling: Refers to how much a piece of code refers on another to run</li>
        <li>The push method such as the one we used for the Todo activity adds one or more elements to the end of an array. In case of the Todo, we added a newTodo onto the end of our existing empty array called todos</li>
