    <h3>Notes</h3> 
        <p>I had known about document.getElementById but didn't know about TagName or Classname. Basically, it returns the object based on the Tagname given. 
            A tag can be li, ul, section, etc. Ex. const listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li'); I guess I would use this if I wasn't needing to call a specific object and instead call a group of objects. From what I gathered from the reading, TagName and ClassName do the same thing, in that they call a collection of objects instead of a single one. So you could proably go any way. 
            Though I would probably use a TagName over ClassName since it would less tedious since you would have to label so many objects with a Class.
             I'm used to accessing properties by dot notation (Ex: person.name) that I didn't realize you could access it using square brackets Ex: person ['name']. It seems that bracket notation allows you more flexibility in naming properties and objects. But I feel like that could also be confusing and get out of hand, so I guess it depends.  </p>
      <p>During the Team activity this week we referenced the JavaScript 30 video's and I noticed that instead of doing an if else, he wrote a shorthand like this:
           return lastPerson > nextPerson ? -1 : 1;  Which I found out that ? means If that is true and : means otherwise do this. I feel like I have seen this before, but I can remember where. But I thought, that's cool and nice. It certainly saves more lines of code. I think I'm going to start doing this from now on.</p>
